=========================

CUPS print plugin for Android

This plugin unpacks minimal Debian installation with CUPS included,
and launches it using PRoot, then uses it for actual printing.

To generate Debian image, download repo https://github.com/pelya/cuntubuntu
and launch script img-cups-wheezy.sh from img directory.

You will need to do this from Debian/Ubuntu, and install few packages, specified in it;s readme file.

PRoot can be downlaoded from http://proot.me/

Other than these things, the plugin contains only Java code, and no other magic.

I hate Java and dislike IDEs, so you'll have to put up with my coding style, sorry.
Don't ask me how to import this project into Android Studio or Eclipse.
